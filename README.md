# py3tree

A reimplementation of [i3tree](https://github.com/sciurus/i3tree) in Python, using [i3ipc](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python).

# Overview

i3tree is a program written by sciurus in Perl for the i3 tiling window manager.

This project is a reimplementation of
this tool in what I consider to be a better language. Also, I can extend it without forcing myself to relearn Perl.

# Usage

TODO.

# Examples

TODO.

# Acknowledgements

Thank you to sciurus for the original i3tree, licensed under the GPLv3.
